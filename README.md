Create a page for your own personal branding that can be treated as the beginning of your portfolio. You should focus on HTML structure and syntax with basic layout using styles.


### Content and Technical Requirements

1. Validate your html page with W3 validator: https://validator.w3.org/
1. Appropriate folder structure: images, css.

1. The page will have a linked JavaScript file for the blog posts section. Create an array to hold your posts (at least 2 posts). Each item in the array must be an object that contains at a minimum the following information: Title, Copy, Date. Use JavaScript to add each post to the DOM.
